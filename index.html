		<h1> Welcome to the Serengeti </h1> 
		<h2> The Serengeti National Park in Tanzania, Africa, is an amazing place filled with over 400 species of fauna. </h2> 
		<div id="text">
			<p> The Serengeti is most famouns for its migration of millions of wildebeest. It is a breathtaking sight that never  ends, a loop going clockwise around the Serengeti, even going into Kenya in the north. However, this is not all the Serengeti is famous for.</p>
			<p> The Serengeti spans over 30,000 square kilometers (12,000 square miles). This is an area larger than the state of Connecticut. This is essentially split up into 3 sections. The southern/central part of the  park, also known as Seronera Valley, is the most popular area of the Serengeti. The Maasai people who live in the area call it "serengit", meaning "the land of endless plains." Indeed, it is all plains and savannah. It has sparse vegetation, but is teeming with wildlife. This is where most of safaris would go. </p> 
			<p> The western area in the Serengeti is mostly defined by the Grumeti River. This area is more forest and dense vegetation, and so is harder to move around. Also, there is not too much wildlife (besides the bugs and small animals). The northernmost part, the Lobo area, meets up with the Masai Mara Reserve at the Kenyan border. This is the least visited area, as there is not much here. </p> 
			<p> Two World Heritage sites and 2 Biosphere Reserves were established within the Serengeti. This is because of it's unique ecosystem, which is actually one of the oldest on the earth - and surprisingly, hasn't changed much! The biodiversity is astonishing. There are the Big Five - lions, leopards, rhinos, cape buffalo, and elephants - that truly give the Serengeti its reputation. In fact, there are over 540 species of birds alone in the Serengeti, and many different kinds of plants.</p>
			<p> This all relates to health and happiness because the Serengeti is part of the culture of Tanzania, and earns revenue quite a lot of revenue for the country. This allows the government to spend more money on schools and other public institutions. This, in turn, allows people better education and social connection, leading to more money. This means that those individuals can spend more money on health care, leading to a healthier life. Social connections, too, lead to a happier and healthier life. Not to mention that the Serengeti is truly breathtaking, and could make a person happier just by seeing the amazing wildlife. </p>
